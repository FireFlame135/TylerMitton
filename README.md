## 📖 Description

This is the foundational code for my highly responsive personal portfolio website. It showcases my projects, blog articles, and professional background. Built with Vite, React, TypeScript, shadcn-ui, and Tailwind CSS. 

Development is lightning-fast thanks to full compatibility with React Fast Refresh. The site features a fully responsive design, client-side routing with React Router, and dynamic contact form validation.

The main branch is `main`, and the production build is deployed to GitHub Pages via the `gh-pages` branch. Thus, the main branch contains the source code, while the `gh-pages` branch hosts the static files for the live site, which have been built and optimized by Vite.
