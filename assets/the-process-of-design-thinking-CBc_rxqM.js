**Tyler Mitton**  

Recently I’ve been reflecting on a particularly influential class I took at BYU-Idaho. Even over 3 years later, it influences how I design and iterate for improvement. This class was about the process of **design thinking** in a team environment.

The step-by-step process goes like this:

1. **Empathize with users**  
2. **Define the problem**  
3. **Ideate/Brainstorm**  
4. **Prototype**  
5. **Test**

## First, Empathize with Users

This step is for understanding everything there is to know about the people for whom you’re designing. You might conduct interviews, observe behaviors, or spend time in their environment. The goal is to see the problem through **their** eyes and really grasp **their** use cases, needs, and pain points.

This requires a mindset shift: you’re not solving your own problems—you’re solving **theirs.**

At first for me, this didn’t compute. For example, I never understood why Apple decides to lock away access to some settings. As a power user of technology, I want nothing more than full customizability. But that’s exactly it. I’m a power user; a tiny portion of a percent of Apple’s customers. They abstract settings to toggles, remove technical jargon, and use terms like *“auto”* and *“optimize”* to allow their millions of average users to offload the granular knowledge onto Apple. This is a masterclass in design to make the settings menu helpful and accessible to **all people,** regardless of technical background. Once you understand the person for whom you’re designing, the next step is to clearly define their problem.

## Second, Define the Problem

By now, the designer should understand the problems of a user. The next step is to boil that down into a problem statement. This should be specific, centered on the user, and actionable.  

This step is easy to gloss over quickly, but don’t fall into that trap. A proper direction is essential for any project.

A plane that flies only one degree off of its intended flight path from New York to LA will end up approximately on Catalina Island, 40 miles from its destination. This sort of thing may be unavoidable for some projects: mistakes will be made. Still, **mindful direction** for a product can streamline the design process in massive ways. Once you have a mindful direction, it’s time to ideate.

## Third, Ideate

Simple and straightforward in theory. And it’s actually just as simple in practice. With a team culture of **no bad ideas,** and an emphasis on quantity over quality at first, you would be shocked at the problems you can solve.  

After open brainstorming, nail down a couple S.M.A.R.T. ideas—Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Timely. Once your team has some S.M.A.R.T. ideas, it’s time for a prototype.

---

## Fourth, Prototype

Effective and efficient prototypes should be made for **quick iteration.** You’re going to fail, so **fail fast** and learn from it.  

These prototypes can be rudimentary: you should build just enough to **learn something.** Then iterate and build again and again until you reach a product you’re willing to test.

---

## Fifth, Test

If possible, put the product in front of real or potential users. You should certainly get feedback on what needs to improve.  

If you haven’t already, this is where you should stop the process and re-evaluate. Based on what you have learned, it’s likely you’ll need to jump back to a previous step. Be mindful about this process. If anything you learned made it seem like you don’t fully understand the user, there is no shame in going back to step one. If you didn’t correctly and specifically define the problem statement on the first go, try going back to step two.

The key is to create a team environment where backtracking isn’t looked down upon. The design process is fundamentally meant to be iterative. You don’t need to prove that you’re right in the testing stage, because the designer is never right; the user is. The designer can only try their best to build for the user by staying humble and willing to backtrack in the process.

The testing phase is meant to direct the designer back to the step where there is a disconnect between the designer and the user, and then continue forward again to the testing phase. Of course, at any point in the design process, you can and should backtrack if there is a need.

## My Experience with Design Thinking

We learned a lot in my BYU-Idaho design thinking course.

We worked as a team to build our capstone project: a professional feeling board game. It took weeks of iteration and many prototypes. We went to parks to play the game with strangers and get feedback. We went back in the process many times to better understand the user or redefine the problem.

And then we ran into the problem:  
**It wasn’t fun.**

The users simply didn’t enjoy the game much. With about half of the time to the deadline passed, we had to face that reality. Because we were novices in the design thinking process at the time, we were all too proud to admit it before then. We tried to change this prototype to be engaging. We didn’t want to buy another box, design another board, and create 50+ new cards. So nobody said anything.

But it wasn’t too late. One team member finally said it. **The game wasn’t fun.** We were all thinking it, and we were all picking up on subtle cues from the strangers we played with. Even they didn’t want to say it, but subconsciously we all knew it just wasn’t a fun game.

That sent us back to square one.

With another few weeks of iteration through the design process, we followed the steps much more properly. We were humble enough to admit when things weren’t working and bright enough to keep improving it.

**And the results showed.**

We ended the semester with an amazing game that we were truly proud of. And it ***was*** fun.

## The Takeaways

Looking back, this experience taught me one of the most valuable aspects of design thinking: **humility**. The process only works if you’re willing to listen, adapt, and put the user’s experience above your own.  

The real magic of design thinking isn’t in having brilliant initial ideas—it’s in building the courage to **change them.**
