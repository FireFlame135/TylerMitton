        Tyler has demonstrated remarkable <span className="font-bold text-black dark:text-gray-50">initiative</span> and <span className="font-bold text-black dark:text-gray-50">dedication</span>. He has been required to <span className="font-bold text-black dark:text-gray-50">learn independently</span> and has done remarkably. One of Tyler's standout qualities is his consistency and dependability. He is someone that I can always count on. He takes ownership of his tasks and shows a <span className="font-bold text-black dark:text-gray-50">genuine eagerness</span> to learn and grow.

          In my year working with Tyler, he was a <span className="font-bold text-black dark:text-gray-50">huge asset</span> and I had a pleasure working with him! Tyler excels at taking initiative, and his superpower is his focus on designing for the user. He was able to carefully consider high level project details and context as he built the lower level details of the courses. Tyler always retained an <span className="font-bold text-black dark:text-gray-50">impressive attention to detail</span> and exceeded expectations.  It was very clear that Tyler has a <span className="font-bold text-black dark:text-gray-50">passion and enthusiasm for design!</span>
